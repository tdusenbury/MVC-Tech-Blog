// build out form on dashboard.handlebars
//form, title, content, submit button
//then write the handler for that form here:

//repeat for comments


//dashboard
//create
//edit => should link to new route with a :id at end of address dashboard/edit/:id  (i.e. dashboard/edit) 
//get request on dashboard-routes.js to go to new page
//which will render a new handlebars document which will contain an html form that will let me edit this post.
//submit button will send a put request to one of api routes and that will update the form (landing page, home page, and dashboard)
// in order for submit button to handle the put request, I need to make an editPost.js to process correctly

//add script tag to handlebars
